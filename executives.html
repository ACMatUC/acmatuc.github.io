    I'm a 4th year computer science major and I've been involved with ACM for three years, previously serving as both president and treasurer. I've been programming for a number of years and I love learning about and sharing tech news and tips.  I love going to hackathons! Feel free to email me anytime at lewis2ku@mail.uc.edu, or in our slack room at @capnkurt!

    I'm a 4th year computer science major at UC interested in C/C++, browser internals, and web standards. I like to study algorithms, math, and help people learn about the programming and the web platform. I'm a big advocate of the modern open web and want to work somewhere that allows me to make an impact on the web platform. I've previously co-oped at Mozilla.
