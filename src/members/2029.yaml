    Hi! I'm Daniel Budke, a Computer Science major here at University of
    Cincinnati. I'm interested in software engineering, web development, user
    interface/user experience, and cybersecurity. Currently, I'm working on
    streetrelay.me, a social media service for the 3DS's StreetPass feature.
