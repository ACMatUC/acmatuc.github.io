# ACM@UC Meeting Archive

Meetings are just markdown files.

Some helpful markdown tips:

* Using `![Alt text](Link)` creates an embedded image
* `<iframe>` tags can be used directly in the markdown

## Where will this meeting be placed in the site?

Replace any `-` in the filename with a `/`, for example:

Meeting named `2026/1-26.md` will be `/meetings/2026/1/26`
