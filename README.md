The official ACM@UC Website, built with Astro, React, and Tailwind. By the
community, for the community.

## Contributing

If you're new to programming or computer science, try working in a Codespace!
It's a batteries-included way to make your first contribution

If you do have some experience, try cloning and working on the repository
locally:

### Fork the Repository

Before working on the repository, you'll likely need your own copy of it to
contribute to. To do that, just click the 'Fork' button at the top of this page.

Once you've made your contribution, you can open a pull request.

### Cloning the Repository

Open the terminal (Control+\` in Visual Studio Code, `cmd` on Windows, or
`Terminal.app` on macOS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ACMatUC/acmatuc.github.io.git
# or, with the GitHub CLI
gh clone ACMatUC/acmatuc.github.io
```

> [!INFO] What is Git? What is `gh`?
> Git is a version control system, allowing you to keep a history of your
> project as you go along.
> It's **highly recommended** you use version control for all of your projects!
>
> `gh` is the GitHub CLI (command-line interface), it makes working with GitHub
> specifically easier from the terminal.

### Install `node`, `yarn` and dependencies

Node.JS is a JavaScript runtime that targets servers, so it's used for hosting
the website. You can install it at
[`nodejs.org`](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Select `with Yarn` (along with
your platform, Windows, macOS, or Linux), and copy-paste the given script to your
command prompt.

Once that's done, open the repository in your favorite code editor
([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a popular choice),
open the terminal (for Visual Studio Code, press Control+\`) and run `yarn` to
install dependencies. Once that completes, you can run `yarn dev` and you'll
have the website running on your computer!
